If you are an  engineering graduate you should have definitley heard this term - Fourier Transform atleast few semesters. And if you are from Electrical background, you must have hated this phrase.

If you ever understood this technique, then damn, you are so cool.

During my college days, I always wanted to know about this term and see the magic its hiding and but did not actually went for it. Even worse, I finished college without why it is even used. I have encountered this phrase many times in my work, studied few bits about, I am sharing my experience of unwinding the **Great Fourier Transform**.

The whole idea of fourier transform is to convert the signal from time domain to frequency domain. 

**So why frequency domain ?**
Well, Some Math geeks found that some of the complex problems in signal processing can be easily solved in frequency domain. Take this following problem. 


**So what is frequency domain ?**
We are familiar with time-domain analysis, it shows how a signal changes over time. Similarly frequency domain show how the signal's energy is distributed over different frequencies. If you convert an audio signal from time domain to frequency , you can see what are the frequencies present in your audio, remove the frequencies you dont want.

They are few ways to convert a signal from time domain to frequency domain, one of them is fourier transform.

One important magic behind the Fourier Transform is the following discovery.

"Joseph Fourier in 1822 found that sine and cosine waves can be combined by summation to create any kind of signal."

It means that any sound, your baby's crying sound or your girlfriends yelling, any thing represented by the combination of sinusoidal waves of different amplitude, phase and frequency.
