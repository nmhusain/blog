### UTF-8

Earlier days computer has to display only a small set of characters, most of us familiar with characters as ASCII text. 

For the characters other than ASCII we needed encoding scheme that accomodates that more that 128 characters. Thus we have Unicode(not a encoding) and UTF-8.

The 8 in the UTF-8 represents the numbers are represented in 8-bit blocks. The number of blocks can be about 1 or 2 or upto 4.
it shares some similar features with ASCII. It supports null terminated strings.
